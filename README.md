# Farm-calc

This app calculates the performance of a [Staking pool](https://github.com/luisgdev/pool-info). 
- For **simple** interest: yield and profit percentage in different periods of time (daily, monthly an yearly). 
- For **compound** interest: list of frequencies to make the compound and the optimal frequency to get highest income with minimal effort.

Pools where staked and reward token are the same whill allow you to do compound interest easier.

This console application uses [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) as a GUI.
